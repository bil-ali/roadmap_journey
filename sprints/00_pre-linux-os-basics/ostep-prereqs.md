# [Pre-Linux OS Basics Sprint / Day 1 / OSTEP Prereq Knowledge]

**Task:**
The Pre-Linux OS Basics Sprint requires me to read the book [*"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"*](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/ "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"). However, the book starts with the following warning:

> If you are taking an undergraduate operating systems course, you should already have some idea of what a computer program does when it runs. If not, this book (and the corresponding course) is going to be difficult — so you should probably stop reading this book, or run to the nearest bookstore and quickly consume the necessary background material before continuing (both Patt & Patel [[PP03]](https://icourse.club/uploads/files/96a2b94d4be48285f2605d843a1e6db37da9a944.pdf "Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond") and Bryant & O’Hallaron
[BOH10](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/Courses/CS295/assets/books/CSAPP_2016.pdf "Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective") are pretty great books).

Since I don't have the time to read these books, this file contains all prereq topics I need knowledge of before OSTEP (with notes).
