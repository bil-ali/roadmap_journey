# [Pre-Linux OS Basics Sprint]
## (27/12/25&ndash;28/12/25)
## **Task:**

The Pre-Linux OS Basics Sprint requires me to read the book [*"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"*](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/ "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"). Specifically, the following chapters in particular:
- **Ch. 2 Introduction to Operating systems**
- **Ch. 4 The Abstraction: The Process**
- **Ch. 5 Interlude: Process API**
- **Ch. 6 Mechanism: Limited Direct Execution**
- **Ch. 39 Interlude: Files and Directories**
- **Ch. 45 Data Integrity and Protection**

## **Proof:**
### Ch. 2 Intro to Operating Systems<br>(27/12/25&ndash;28/12/25)

OSTEP's three major themes:
- **Virualization**
- **Concurrency**
- **Persistence**

The OS's key technique: **virtualization**.<br>
The OS's API: **system calls**.

Each process has its own private virtual address space.

The OS's software that usually manages the disk (HDD, SSD): **file system**.<br>
It is responsible for storing any files the user creates in a reliable and efficient manner on the disks of the system.

#### **What OS Does**
> It takes physical resources, such as a CPU, memory, or disk, and **virtualizes** them. It handles tough and tricky issues related to **concurrency**. And it stores files **persistently**, thus making them safe over the long-term.

#### **OS Design Goals:**

## **Takeaway:**
