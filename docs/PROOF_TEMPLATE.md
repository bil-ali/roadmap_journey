# [Sprint/Day/Topic Name]

**Task:**  
Describe clearly what you were supposed to do (from the roadmap).

**Proof:**  
- Screenshot, code snippet, or CI badge here.  
- If code: add a fenced block with short snippet (not the entire file).  
- If screenshot: store in `images/` and link like:
  `![description](images/filename.png)`  

**Takeaway:**  
One or two sentences about what you learned and why it matters.
