# Roadmap Journey

### A single public home for my **12-month “Python Back-End / Data-Engineer” roadmap** and proof of work.

It contains proofs, projects, and artifacts that show deliberate skill growth toward entry-level developer roles.

The focus is on **practical depth in Python backend** (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, testing, security, CI/CD) while building **adjacent breadth in data engineering and DevOps**, plus a light ML flavor.  
The plan also weaves in **core CS fundamentals** (OS, networking, data structures/algorithms, and databases) so skills are grounded in first principles.

- **`sprints/`** → learning-focused blocks (Fundamentals like OS, Linux, Networking, Security, etc.; tools like PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Django, Redis, etc.).  
- **`projects/`** → larger portfolio deliverables deployed to AWS.  
- **`docs/`** → templates, style guides, and timeline snapshots.
- **`images/`** → screenshots/logs referenced inside proofs.

## 🧾 Proof of Work

Each sprint or task includes a **short `.md` proof** with:

1. **Task:** What I attempted.  
2. **Proof:** Screenshot, code/log snippet, or CI badge.  
3. **Takeaway:** Short key takeaways
